# Mastermind Game

## Introduction

This Python program implements the classic Mastermind game where the player needs to guess a secret code consisting of four colors. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess to help them deduce the correct code. The player has limited chances to guess the code, and if they fail to guess within the given chances, the game ends.

## Features

- Allows the player to input a four-digit code based on a predefined set of colors.
- Provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating the correctness of their choices.
- Ends the game if the player either correctly guesses the code or exceeds the maximum number of allowed guesses.
- Offers the option to play multiple rounds of the game.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Follow the instructions to input your guesses for the secret code.
4. Continue guessing until you either correctly guess the code or run out of chances.
5. Decide whether to play another round after finishing the game.

- 1: White
- 2: Blue
